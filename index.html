        Hi, My name's Toby. I'm a 16 year old software developer who has worked
        on several projects in python, html and css. This is one of my projects
        in fact!

      <h3>
        I started looking into programming when I was about 13, working on some
        very simple python applications. I really started getting into
        programming when I was 15, using python to create some GUIs. In this
        section of the website, you will be able to see some of the different
        things that I've worked on.
