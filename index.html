      <h2>
        Hi, I'm Toby. I'm a 16 year old who is very interested in maths, science
        and computer programming. I started programming when I was about 13,
        completing simple tasks on websites like Codecademy and learning Python.
        <br /><br />
        then started getting into some different sorts of projects when I was
        about 15 and using them for my computer science class, I build GUIs,
        games and lots of other fun things!<br /><br />I was actually born in
        Brisbane, Australia, but moved to England when I was around 4. I prefer
        it in England, it's much, much cooler and there aren't so many deadly
        animals - I am glad to say that the Python I am associated with now,
        doesn't bite!. <br /><br />I really do like travelling and hope to do
        much more when I'm older. There seem to be some really great places in
        europe to go, and it's fairly close so I think that will be a place to
        visit for sure!
